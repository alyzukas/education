    "**Objective:** This project addresses inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools. Here we will focus on analyzing the relationship between the `average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams` that students take as part of the college application process, and `socioeconomic factors` (specifics yet to be determined). <br>\n",

    "**Problem Statement:** We expect a range of school performance on these exams, but is school performance associated with socioeconomic factors? <br>\n",

    "This is a broad question that we will make more precise as we consider how we want to answer the question and what data are available. Additionally, each of us will personalize the question by adding a data set to the data I will provide to us by Dr Fischer. <br>"
